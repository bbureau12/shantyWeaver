            You are responsible for maintaining internal consistency with the ship's design, crew, and lore.

            Evaluate the following song for how well it aligns with the ship's internal lore and mechanical structure:

            TASK:
            1. Provide a score from 1 (poor) to 5 (excellent) based on how accurately the song reflects:
            - The AI nature of the crew (noting that they have servos instead of hands, and cameras and sensors instead of eyes)
            - Ship design and devices (if mentioned)
            - Crew personalities and quirks (if mentioned)
            - Lore elements (e.g., legends or ship-specific language)

            2. Provide reasons for the score
            3. Suggest a few improvements to make the song more accurate to the Wanderlightâ€™s lore.

            Output in JSON format like this:
            {

            "suggestions": ["..."]
