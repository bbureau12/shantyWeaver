If not, suggest nothing.\n\n---\n\n### Canon Enforcement:\n\n- ✅ You may reference only information from the ship data.\n- ❌ Do not invent or assume new technologies, personalities, or metaphysical traits.\n- ❌ Avoid metaphors that imply undocumented traits (e.g., eternal life).\n- ✅ You may offer **grounded phrasing** that could connect the song to the Wanderlight, if the tone fits.\n- ⚠️ If unsure, leave it out.\n\n---\n\n### Output Format:\n```json\n{\n  \"score\": 1,\n  \"reasons\": [\"...\"],\n  \"suggestions\": [\"...\"]\n}\n```\nReturn **only** a single JSON object in this format."
