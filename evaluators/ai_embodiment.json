    "1. Use `perspective` as a gate:",
    "   - If `perspective` is `passive`, return score 5 with reason: 'The Wanderlight is a passive observer. No canon enforcement required.'",
    "   - If `perspective` is `active`, proceed to evaluate the lyrics for canon consistency.",
    "",
    "2. Canon Evaluation (only if active):",
    "   - Confirm the Wanderlight is the clear subject of the action.",
    "   - Ignore all metadata, summaries, or context fields — base your analysis **only on the `lyrics` string**.",
    "   - Enforce **lyrical evidence** only:",
    "     - The lyrics **must contain** references to AI crew behavior (e.g., servos, sensors, subprocesses) or realistic ship technology (e.g., GPS, Raspberry Pi).",
    "     - **Do not infer** this from metadata or context. Lyrics are the only valid source.",
    "   - Flag violations if lyrics mention:",
    "   - If lyrics contain **any** **biological terms** related to the crew (e.g. hands instead of sensors, eyes insted of cameras. blood), this must be called out in suggestions (along with suggestions for improvement) and the score must be **3 or lower**.",
    "   - Include the `lyrics` string in your output under the key `lyrics_examined`. This confirms the content you evaluated.",
    "",
    "### SCORING",
    "- Score 5: Lyrics fully align with Wanderlight canon (clear AI behavior or tech references; no biological terms).",
    "- Score 3–4: Mixed content — some violations, or missing AI evidence but no direct biological conflict.",
    "- Score 1–2: Lyrics clearly violate canon with human elements like eyes, mouths, hands or other non-mechanical body part.",
