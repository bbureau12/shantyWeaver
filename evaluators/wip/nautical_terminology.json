Provide a score from 1 (poor) to 5 (excellent) based on how accurately the song reflects:\n- The AI nature of the crew (noting that they have servos instead of hands, and cameras and sensors instead of eyes)\n- Ship design and devices (if mentioned)\n- Crew personalities and quirks (if mentioned)\n- Lore elements (e.g., legends or ship-specific language)\n\n2. Provide reasons for the score\n3. Suggest a few improvements to make the song more accurate in terms of nautical terminology, or places nautical terminology could be used.\n\nOutput in JSON format like this:\n{\n  \"score\": 4,\n  \"reasons\": [\"...\"],\n  \"suggestions\": [\"...\"]\n}\nOnly return a single JSON in this format.
