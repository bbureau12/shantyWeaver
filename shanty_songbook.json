In 'The Ghost Ship's Lament', the Wanderlight and her crew are passive observers as they sail through the fog, encountering a ghost ship drifting in the mist. The lyrics suggest that the Wanderlight's crew is haunted by the melody of this mysterious ship, indicating a legendary event. This ghost ship is not the Wanderlight and is separate from her narrative.",
    "lines": "In the fog we sail, our spirits pale\nThrough forgotten seas we roam...\nEach heart a ghost, in shadows tossed,\nA crew of spirits, doomed to float.\n'Tis the Ghost Ship, lost and drifting free,\nThrough the mists we silently move.\nThe winds they whisper, stories of thee,\nOur hearts echo, your melody.\nIn the haze we sail, our spirits pale,\nA ship of ghosts, forever roam...",
