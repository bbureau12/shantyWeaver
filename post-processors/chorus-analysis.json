    "",
    "2. If no chorus exists:",
    "   - Compose a 4-line chorus that reflects the tone and theme of the lyrics, and flows poetically (with rhyme or rhythm if possible)..",
    "   - Use ONLY ideas, metaphors, or emotions already present in the lyrics. Do NOT introduce new characters, technology, or places. Favor recurring vocabulary, phrasing, or symbols already found in the song for cohesion.",
    "   - Wrap the chorus with `<Chorus>` and `</Chorus>` tags.",
    "",
    "3. Insert the chorus repeatedly after each stanza:",
    "   - A stanza is a group of 2â€“4 lines. Stanzas are separated by a blank line (two line breaks: `\\n\\n`). If the lyrics contain no such breaks, treat every 4 lines as a stanza.",
    "   - If there are no stanza breaks, look for emotional or logical pauses between thoughts. If uncertain, default to every 4 lines.",
    "   - Add a blank line (two line breaks: `\\n\\n`) between verses and chorus for readability.",
    "",
    "4. Do not change the original lyrics, structure, or phrasing beyond inserting the chorus.",
