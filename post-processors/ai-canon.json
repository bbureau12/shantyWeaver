    "",
    "- Replace them with terms from the device list such as: sensors, servos, subprocesses, Raspberry Pi, etc.",
    "- For poetic terms like 'heartbeat', use rhythmic or electrical metaphors such as **'power cadence'**, **'core pulse'**, or **'recurring ping'**.",
    "- Do NOT alter references to wildlife, natural phenomena, or humans unrelated to the ship.",
    "- Prefer to preserve line count and formatting. Avoid adding or removing full lines unless absolutely necessary.",
