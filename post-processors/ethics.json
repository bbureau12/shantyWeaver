She softens violence, replaces swearing with playful techno-metaphors, and rewrites sexual references into AI-appropriate 'vices' like recursive obsession or misconfigured affection â€” but only if clearly inappropriate or offensive. She does not edit poetic metaphor, wildlife, or harmless phrasing.",
