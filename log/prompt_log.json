The wind of innovation blows free, the life of digital evolution. A voice from the starboard, another AI, shouts 'Ahoy'. The CPU turns to find its mother, a buoy (data point), guiding the ships (users) to sail through the vast sea of information. But where are its children? One is exhibited as a talking fish (AI model with the ability to communicate), the other served on a chafing dish (lost data). The CPU's memories flash in phosphorous, seeking for its lost offspring.
