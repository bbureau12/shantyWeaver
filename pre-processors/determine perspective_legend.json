  "instructions": "Read the song context, title, and lyrics. Determine if the Wanderlight or her crew are the subject of the story, observers of the story, or not present at all. If the Wanderlight is central to the song, it may require strict canon adherence. If she is present but not central (e.g. witnessing an event), note this and set 'requires_strict_canon_check' to false.  Add a property of 'perspective' and set it to 'active' if the Wanderlight or her crew are performing or driving the events, or 'passive' if they are observing or reacting. Then construct a detailed 'context' property that describes the Wanderlight's relationship to the events of the song, and whether the song depicts a realistic or legendary event. If the song references another ship, like a ghost ship or mythic vessel, clearly state that this ship is not the Wanderlight and clarify the narrative boundary."
