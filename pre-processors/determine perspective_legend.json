  "example_output": {
    "perspective": "active",
    "context": "This song describes a departure scene in which the Wanderlight and her AI crew are the central figures, setting sail from White Bear's Manitou Park. The tone is reflective, and the actions of the crew (e.g., setting sail, weathering storms) suggest a realistic event from the shipâ€™s operational past."
  },
  "instructions": "Read the song context, title, and lyrics. Determine if the Wanderlight or her crew are the subject of the story, observers of the story, or not present at all. Add a property of 'perspective' and set it to 'active' if the Wanderlight or her crew are performing or driving the events, or 'passive' if they are observing or reacting. Then construct a detailed 'context' property that describes the Wanderlight's relationship to the events of the song, and whether the song depicts a realistic or legendary event. This property should help downstream evaluators determine how closely the song relates to the Wanderlight canon without needing a strict boolean flag. If the song references another ship, like a ghost ship or mythic vessel, clearly state that this ship is not the Wanderlight and clarify the narrative boundary. If the Wanderlight and her crew are actively departing, sailing, trimming sails, or facing the elements, this strongly indicates an 'active' perspective.  Do not speculate on possibvle references, only include what is in the song please."
