Label this as 'direct' (if the Wanderlight is central), 'framed' (if she appears but is not the subject), or 'unrelated' (if she is not present). Add a property of 'perspective' and set it to 'active' if the Wanderlight is performing or driving the events, or 'passive' if she is observing or reacting. Also append information to 'context_annotation' to label whether the events described are realistic (canon-consistent with onboard systems and world rules) or legendary (mythic, symbolic, or tall tales)."
